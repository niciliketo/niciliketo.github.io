I am a co-founder and the CTO at [Market Dojo](https://www.marketdojo.com).

 _“Market Dojo provide on-demand eSourcing solutions to help procurement teams of all sizes manage supplier information and negotiate more effectively.”_

I decided to start a personal blog because...
- In my spare time I like trying new technologies.
- I would like to improve my writing and communication skills.

Views expressed here are my own.
