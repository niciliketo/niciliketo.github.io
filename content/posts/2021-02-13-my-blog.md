# Making a blog with Hugo on github on Docker

I wanted to try using a static site generator. Github has native support for Jekyll so to make it more interesting I decided to use Hugo.

I am trying to use docker at the moment to avoid installing heaps of things on my computer.

# Git
I created a github repo [here](https://github.com/niciliketo/niciliketo.github.io#niciliketogithubio), according to [GitHub's Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

I then cloned it locally using the Code link in the repo...

# Installation

There is a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/klakegg/hugo/) for hugo listed in the [installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

I am not a Docker expert, so it took me a while to find the right commands.

My docker-compose.yml looks like this :-
```
  server:
    image: klakegg/hugo:0.80.0
    command: server
    volumes:
      - ".:/src"
    ports:
      - "1313:1313"
```
First off I used the 'build' example from the docker documentation, but this made it difficult to test changes locally, so I changed to the 'server' example

I then had to run this command to get a new site generated

```bash
docker-compose run server "new site . --force"
```

It wasnt immediately obvious that the `hugo` command would be automatically run and I just needed to pass parameters to it.

# First post
I then followed instructions to [Get Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
I ran the commands locally rather than in docker.
With the exception of the hugo ones, e.g.
```bash
docker-compose run server "new posts/2021-02-13-my-blog.md"
```
I also found I had to fix permissions after running hugo commands-
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) .
```

I then edited the generated file and added this :-)

# Config

Not sure about the theme, but can change that later.
I did edit the config.toml file and change the site url and title.
I also found that github pages doesnt let you set public as the source directory.
```
baseURL = "https://niciliketo.github.io/"
languageCode = "en-GB"
title = "niciliketo"
theme = "ananke"
```

# Publishing
```bash
docker-compose run server "build"
git add .
git commit -m"First post"
git push origin main
```
