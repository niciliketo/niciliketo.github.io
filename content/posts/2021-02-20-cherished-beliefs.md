I listened to a new Podcast today (it was a recommendation from Twitter).

[You are not so smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/)


The episode was part 1 of 3 on The Backfire Effect. It seems like there are some uncertainty whether this is a real thing, but the episode was interesting.

It covered recent research on what happens in your brain when your beliefs are challenged. They gave examples of two types of belief.
- Things you believe, but are not really invested in (the example was that Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb)
- Things you believe, and are really invested in (e.g. America should introduce stricter gun controls)

The research involved finding people that believed these things, putting them in a MRI and then giving them information which contradicted the belief.

What they found was that different parts of the brain were activated for the belief that people were invested in. The host of the podcast observed how he felt different when the gun control belief was challenged, and as I listened I found myself making counter-arguments in my head too.

The researchers said that the reaction in the brain was similar to the fight or flight reaction you get in times of physical danger. They went on to discuss why that might be.

They need to do more research to reach a conclusion on this, but one theory put forward was that changing your mind about one of these cherished beliefs might be risky. For example, if you do change your mind, and hold a belief that puts you at odds with your family and friends, you could end up falling out with them.

They also suggested that we could combat the reaction by trying to build a sense of self around what you do rather than what you believe and also to try and be more logical and less emotional when discussing these types of subject.

The podcast was thought provoking, and although I donâ€™t think the advice is easy to implement, it is something to think about in the future.

There was also a bonus link to the [Wikipedia page on common misconcptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions)
