I want to implement a RAG system that will index a set of documents and then answer questions based on them.
My plan is to use our ISO27001 ISMS documents to answer security questions from suppliers.

The basic plan was

1. Build it inside docker
2. Use Langchain to make it all work
3. Use ElasticSearch for the retrieval part
4. Use Open AI API initially, but hopefully a local LLM in the future

Here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/niciliketo/rag)
