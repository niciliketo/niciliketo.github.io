I have had a bit of time on my hands recently. Several people mentioned taking advantage of this to learn new hobbies or skills and I was inspired to read some big books.

I chose The Bible because I know a few of the stories, but thought there was probably quite a lot I had missed. I don't come from a Christian background, but I think this book still has a very strong influence on society.

It has taken me a long time to get through it. Originally I was hoping to get to the new testament in time for Christmas, but that proved pretty ambitious. I didn't find the story gripping which didn't help my progress but was a fantastic aid in getting to sleep.

A lot of the writing is very old, and mostly unknown authors have contributed different parts. This gives the book a mixture of different styles with some parts more readable than others.

The parts I found most interesting were also the parts I was familar with. These included Genesis which is quite fast paced covering Adam and Eve through to death of Joseph. There were some slower sections, including a lot of details of who begat who, but overall I would score this section 7/10.

Throughout the old testament there were some interesting things I learnt. For example, there was a lot of animal sacrifice, which I had not expected, and the etymology of 'scapegoat' which was a goat symbolically used to remove peoples sins by sending it out into the desert. I had also never really known about what happened when the Israelites arrived in the promised land. I also hadn't known that Solomon was David's son.

There are also some strong characters in the story,

On the negative side, I wouldn't describe the bible as a page-turner. The interesting parts are often followed with hard to follow details of family trees. There is also quite a lot of repitition. Kings and Chronicles are a retelling of the same story. A modern editor would almost definitely have cut or combined the two.


# Conclusion

Familiar story as well as many intersting sections. A must-read for Christians, and great background for anyone trying to understand Christianity. 6/10.
