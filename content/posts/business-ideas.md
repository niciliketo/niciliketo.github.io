# Business Ideas

## Survey API tool

A survey tool which
- allows you to create surves via an API.
- provides a js to embed the survey in a website.
- uses text analysis to understand the text part of the results
- provides a way to interrogate both structured and unstructured data

### Motivation
This was a part of the solution we offered at Attensity, but we now have ML text analysis.

## Public API for stock checks

An API which allow trusted partners to check stock levels at a particular retailers store.

### Motivation

At Eqos we offerered Supplier Relationship Management solutions which allowed suppliers to check stock levels of their product at specific stores.
I recently heard a Podcast featuring Deliveroo CEO who mentioned the problem of out of stock items for them. The solution he mentioend was 'dark stores' where they can track stock levels because they are the only ones who use them, but it seems like this could be solved with an API to trusted partners.
