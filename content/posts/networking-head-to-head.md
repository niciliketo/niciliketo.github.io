Today I want to do a head to head review of two networking solutions.

# Background
I am fortunate enough to live in a house. I am also fortunate that the house has plenty of space in it and is divided up by walls.

If that wasn't enough I am also blessed by a 35Mbps internet connection.

# First world problem
I am unfortunate that the internet connection is in one corner on the ground floor of my house, while my desk and computer are in the opposite corner on the first floor.

This causes a lot of problems when trying to do things like make VOIP calls, download big files or sometimes even just view a webpage.

In the past I have tried a few different solutions -
- WiFi from the router (very inconsistent)
- Powerline adapter (again inconsistent, works amazingly some days and then just stops. Usually a couple of minutes before I am due to join a web meeting)
- Wireless repeater (its plugged in, and says its working, but it isnt a noticeable improvement on the Wifi from the router)

# Incumbent champion
A couple of months ago, I decided to try something new. This is the current incumbent champion and what I use on a day-to-day basis.

It works pretty well, although its only a metter of time until someone trips over it. It also helps me switch off at the end of the day as it was only supposed to be for use in emergencies and I have committed to winding it in each evening.

# Challenger

I got this from Amazon. It was very expensive, but as I have tried a couple of other solutions that have not worked, I wanted the best chance of sucesss.

After setting up the first device, my computer was unable to connect.
Adding a second device still resulted in my computer trying to connect, but failing. I then realised I hadnt used the companion app to set up the second device.
After setup the wifi still seemed flakey, but I could connect a cable from the TP-Link device to my computer. This connected very quickly.

# Conclusion

I will need to use this for a while before deciding if it lives up to the initial impression, but so far, so good.
