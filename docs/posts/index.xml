      <description>I listened to a new Podcast today (it was a recommendation from Twitter).
You are not so smart
The episode was part 1 of 3 on The Backfire Effect. It seems like there are some uncertainty whether this is a real thing, but the episode was interesting.
It covered recent research on what happens in your brain when your beliefs are challenged. They gave examples of two types of belief.</description>

      <description>Today I want to do a head to head review of two networking solutions.
Background I am fortunate enough to live in a house. I am also fortunate that the house has plenty of space in it and is divided up by walls.
If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough I am also blessed by a 35Mbps internet connection.
First world problem I am unfortunate that the internet connection is in one corner on the ground floor of my house, while my desk and computer are in the opposite corner on the first floor.</description>

      <description>Tip of the day If you are writing two valentines cards, to two different people and they are different sizes. Make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t write the wrong name on the envelope!
Trick of the day (Hugo) I found that following the README for the Ananke theme was quite helpful. Especially copying the config.toml from the example site, which magically made the About and Posts menu items appear. It also allowed me to add links to some social sites and customise the home and about pages.</description>

      <description>I wanted to try using a static site generator. Github has native support for Jekyll so to make it more interesting I decided to use Hugo.
I am experimenting with Docker at the moment to avoid installing heaps of things on my computer.
GitHub I created a github repo here, according to GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Instructions
I then cloned it locally using the Code link in the repo&amp;hellip;
Installation There is a docker image for hugo listed in the installation instructions.</description>
