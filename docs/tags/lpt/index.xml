      <description>Tip of the day If you are writing two valentines cards, to two different people and they are different sizes. Make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t write the wrong name on the envelope!
Trick of the day (Hugo) I found that following the README for the Ananke theme was quite helpful. Especially copying the config.toml from the example site, which magically made the About and Posts menu items appear. It also allowed me to add links to some social sites and customise the home and about pages.</description>
