      <description>Today I want to do a head to head review of two networking solutions.
Background I am fortunate enough to live in a house. I am also fortunate that the house has plenty of space in it and is divided up by walls.
If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough I am also blessed by a 35Mbps internet connection.
First world problem I am unfortunate that the internet connection is in one corner on the ground floor of my house, while my desk and computer are in the opposite corner on the first floor.</description>
